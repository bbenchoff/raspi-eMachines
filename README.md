This is the repository of the 3D files and graphics for the Raspberry Pi eMachines Never Obsolete case.

Various hardware is required to build this case, including:

- No. 2 pan head Philips screws
- [Buy these adapter boards](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08V5MXLS6)
- [and this USB-C right angle adapter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086W2LTGY)

Assembly is simple, as the Pi screws directly to the chassis -- the front and shell simply clip onto the chassis. This allows the chassis to be the 'core' of other very small scale model builds, just print a new shell and face and clip it onto the chassis.

## Decals

The stickers used on this case are waterslide decals, printed on an Alps dye-sub printer. The decal sheet was printed through [Bedlam Creations](https://www.bedlamcreations.com/), at a cost of about $10 for a 75x50mm sheet. This decal sheet also includes the graphics for the raspi-SGIIndy case, so if you're making one you might as well make two.

The illustrator file for the waterslide graphics are provided in the relevant directory.
